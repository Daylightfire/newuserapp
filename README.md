# New user app
Basic app build in Python / Mqsql / Azure for new user set up / licence requests

Simple plan for the app is to progress from linux vm  / azure mysql to using containers so I can build out the migration as well.

# Notes
This is a skills development app as my python / css / mysql skills are still developing.

# Imaginary Business request
Business request ticket -

"Make it easier for users to put in New User requests to the service desk, also we need a better way to keep track of software licences / user access"

Solution - 
1. Secure 2 tier python / mysql app build in azure with straight forward drop down selections for software and access.
2. Fields should be limited entry and things like usernames, email etc should be generated by the app. The requestor should only have to input the new users first and second name and select software / access required
3. Create a scheduled report to keep licence and access info

Solution Stretch - 
1. App and DB should be able to be run in containers
2. Minimize costs with set hours for the app to be running
3. App should be part of an Azure Devops Pipeline for future dev and source control
